                The Ultimate Productivity Hack is Saying No
            </a>
            <span class="post-date">12 feb 2022</span>
            <p class="post-decription">he ultimate productivity hack is saying no.

                Not doing something will always be faster than doing it. This statement reminds me of the old computer programming saying, “Remember that there is no code faster than no code.”
                
                The same philosophy applies in other areas of life. For example, there is no meeting that goes faster than not having a meeting at all.
                
                This is not to say you should never attend another meeting, but the truth is that we say yes to many things we don’t actually want to do. There are many meetings held that don’t need to be held. There is a lot of code written that could be deleted.</p>

                    Great Migrations Of Birds I Ever Seen In My Life
                </a>
                <span class="post-date">30 nov 2022</span>
                <p class="post-decription"> The refuge is famous for being a critical stopover for a number of different migrating species, though for me the sandhill cranes and snow geese are a fan favorite. Their numbers are so great that they blot out the sky. If you are lucky enough to be near an area they are landing to feed, it can almost be overwhelming as their calls can be deafening. The refuge is about 2 hours south of Albuquerque, which is the biggest city in the state.he best times to visit are mid-November through mid-february, but I usually go in mid-December, during the holidays, as I’ve made it somewhat of a tradition to go with my father, who is also a photographer and lives nearby. We always bring our cameras, and I look forward to our day trip all year long, but I also love our tradition of stopping at the Buckhorn Tavern for a famous green chile burger at the end of a long day in the field.
            
                    Most Snow Geese come from Northern Canada, flying up to 1500 miles and cruising along at 40 miles per hour. They mate for life, so they are cruising along with their partner and sometimes their young.
                    
                    Sandhill Cranes are much larger, standing 3-4 feet tall and have a massive wingspan of 6 feet. They breed in Canada, Alaska and Siberia and although they were once almost extinct, they have recovered dramatically because of places like this National Wildlife Refuge.
                    
                    They also have an incredible sound that is very distinct, I imagine a pterodactyl would sound like this, cawwwwwwwwwwye cawwwwwye!</p>

                How Innovative Ideas Arise To Change ourselves
            </a>
            <span class="post-date">2 sep 2023</span>
            <p class="post-decription">In 2010, Thomas Thwaites decided he wanted to build a toaster from scratch. He walked into a shop, purchased the cheapest toaster he could find, and promptly went home and broke it down piece by piece.

                Thwaites had assumed the toaster would be a relatively simple machine. By the time he was finished deconstructing it, however, there were more than 400 components laid out on his floor. The toaster contained over 100 different materials with three of the primary ones being plastic, nickel, and steel.
                
                He decided to create the steel components first. After discovering that iron ore was required to make steel, Thwaites called up an iron mine in his region and asked if they would let him use some for the project.
                
                Surprisingly, they agreed.
                The Toaster Project
                The victory was short-lived.
                
                When it came time to create the plastic case for his toaster, Thwaites realized he would need crude oil to make the plastic.</p>

            <p class="post-decription">There is a multi-billion dollar industry dedicated to self care — around $450 billion, to be precise. And while self-care practices are an important part of cultivating self-love, it's not everything. To put it another way, while bath bombs and massages are ways of expressing your love for yourself, they’re not necessarily how you build it.
                Many of us have been subject to a variety of messages around self-love and how to cultivate it. We may</p>

                    Why Facts Don’t Change Our Minds
                </a>
                <span class="post-date">14 feb 2020</span>
                <p class="post-decription">The economist J.K. Galbraith once wrote, “Faced with a choice between changing one’s mind and proving there is no need to do so, almost everyone gets busy with the proof.”

                    Leo Tolstoy was even bolder: “The most difficult subjects can be explained to the most slow-witted man if he has not formed any idea of them already; but the simplest thing cannot be made clear to the most intelligent man if he is firmly persuaded that he knows already, without a shadow of doubt, what is laid before him.”
                    
                    What’s going on here? Why don’t facts change our minds? And why would someone continue to believe a false or inaccurate idea anyway? How do such behaviors serve us?

                The Ancient Monkey Puzzle Tree Outlasted Dinosaurs. Now It's Facing Extinction.
            </a>
            <span class="post-date">18 aug 2023</span>
            <p class="post-decription">The monkey puzzle tree is a remnant of the Jurassic era, more than 145 million years ago, surviving way past its ancient dinosaur counterparts. Reaching heights of about 160 feet, the evergreen tree has a lifespan of up to 700 years and stiff scaly branches with rigid spiral leaves. Monkey puzzle trees’ presence in the wild is shrinking and after million years, their very existence is now endangered.Monkey puzzle trees or araucaria araucana, are only known to grow in Chile and Argentina, along the slopes of Patagonia’s volcanos. Due to increased human habitat encroachment, fires, and overgrazing, the forest habitat for the monkey puzzle tree grows has rapidly shrunk.

                The extinction of this ancient tree poses a threat to the austral parakeet, which rely on its large seeds as a food source. Monkey puzzle pine nuts are vital to the flocks of green-hued parrots and studies show that both the tree and the parakeets benefit from this symbiotic relationship.In addition to the parakeets, the monkey puzzle pine nuts are a traditional food source for the Indigenous Mapuche people. Using skillful climbing, the Mapuche people climb the trees to gather pine nuts. The monkey puzzle pine nuts are then pounded into that is utilized in bread recipes. Although the Mapuche people have the right to collect pine nuts in their ancestral areas, the local government restricts the quantity collected by the general public and requires a permit for commercial purposes.</p>

                    Baby Bear Takes a Trip on Hallucinogenic ‘Mad Honey’

                <p class="post-decription">>A bear cub was rescued in Turkey after passing out from eating too much hallucinogenic honey.Turkish officials rescued a brown bear cub who had become accidentally intoxicated after consuming a Turkish hallucinogenic honey called ‘mad honey’ or ‘deli bal.’

                    The bear cub was found passed out 130 miles east of Istanbul, in Turkey’s northwestern Duzce province, after getting her paws into too much deli bal.Deli bal is a bitter honey originating from the Black Sea region. The honey is known for giving the consumer a sense of euphoria and hallucinations, the result of bees feeding on the nectar of Rhododendron which contains a natural neurotoxin. As the bear cub quickly learned, too much mad honey can land people, and bears, in the hospital.
                    
                    Turkey’s Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry shared a video showing the bear in a trippy state.</p>
